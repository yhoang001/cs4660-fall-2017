# Environment Setup Exercise

Hello there! This article will cover the basic tests for you to know if your
environment is ready!

To test if your local dev environment is ready, we will test the following:

* Python installation
* Git
* Github

## Python installation

To test if your Python installation is ready, we will be testing if you can run
the command `python -m unittest discover` and see if test cases are passing or
what not.

## Git/Github

To test your Git/Github environment set up, we will need to first set up your
**student repository** through https://classroom.github.com/a/5llmpWhz

Once set up your student repo, continue to read the article below to understand
basic Git https://github.com/csula/Utilities/blob/master/tutorials/git.md

After you finished reading the above tutorial, proceed to download the source
code in the `cs4660` folder.
