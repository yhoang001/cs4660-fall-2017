Hello there! In this exercise, we will test some basic implementation in Python.

In order to ensure you are ready for the upcoming implementations, I'll need to
test a couple things one by one. Namely being able to read file and parse the
string content because you will need to do so in the following homework.

## Get Started

To get started, you will need to get the source code from the course repository,
you may do so by copying and pasting the content from the course repository.

Or, you may use the helpful predefined shell script `scripts/pull-source.sh` to
download the content using Git.

```
# rcliao @ Erics-MacBook-Pro in ~/dev/csula/students/cs4660-fall-2017-rcliao on git:exercise-python o [0:42:11]
$ ./scripts/pull-source.sh tutorial
```

## Coding

From here, you will need to finish up the implementations under `cs4660/tutorial`
folder.

Check the files there and finish the empty method implementation just like exercise
we did last week!

When you are done coding, make sure to `commit` and `push` and create `pull request`.

Submit the pull request address to CSNS And you are done :)
