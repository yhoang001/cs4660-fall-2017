# Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

Welcome to Artificial Intelligence course!

In this course, we start by learning the classic AI problem (knowledge
representation with *Graph data structure* & many different search algorithms) to
Machine Learning space (some intro to Python Scikit learn and further into the 
computer vision space).

In the first half of lecture, we will not just be learning the algorithm but
implementing them in practice. In specific, we will be utilizing the Graph data
structure to implement various search algorithms.

To make testing and grading trivial, we will also be using CI (Continuous
Integration) that runs the test cases against your code to ensure your code performs
as expected. This is, so to called, Test-Driven-Development.

And from the second half of lecture, we will dive into recently trending area of
AI -- Machine Learning.

In this part of lecture, you will be learning Scikit Learn library to do Machine
Learning algorithms. Furthermore, using these Machine Learning models to solve
advance problem like image recognition.

Final project on the other hand will involve you to use all techniques learned in
class to be applied into simple game playing.

## Get Started

To get started, you will need to have some basic tools ready:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Text editor -- recommended VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Terminal -- or Git Bash on Windows

Then you can start hacking codes on the `cs4660` folder.

To run all tests, run the following command in terminal:

```
python -m unittest discover
```
