# Artificial Intelligence

## Course Overview

- **Objectives** The primary objective of this course is to introduce knowledge representation, problem solving and learning methods of Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, students will be learning how to apply such techniques to games.
- **Expectations** Students are expected to have programming experience in at least one language. Python experience is preferred, as the course will be taught in Python. In addition, students are expected to devote a large amount of time learning how to implement algorithms learned in class.

## Logistics

- **Instructors** Hsiang-Yu (Eric) Liao [rcliao01@gmail.com](mailto:rcliao01@gmail.com), Mark Sargent [msargen2@calstatela.edu](mailto:msargen2@calstatela.edu)
- **Lecture** Saturday 8:00 AM to 10:45 AM
- **Office Hours** Eric: Saturday 10:45 AM to 12:00 PM or online 24/7, Mark: Fri 9am to 12pm
- **Office Hours Location** E&T A310 (the old Senior Design room)
- **Lecture Location** SH C141
- **Text Book** None as we will have all notes hosted either on Github or on CSNS.

> Recommended text book: Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig

> As the university notice, we (part-time lecturers) can use the library room -- Palmer Wing room 2097 -- for the office hour purposes.
> Thus, if you don't find us in the classroom, please find us at the library.

## Course Objectives (ambitious): 

### Part I --- Classic AI (Eric, weeks 1-8)

* Knowledge Representation (Graph, Node and Edge)
* Brute force searching algorithm (DFS & BFS)
* Heuristic searching algorithm (A*)
* Adversarial Search (MiniMax & Alpha-Beta pruning)
* Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)

### Part II --- Machine Learning and Computer Vision (Mark, weeks 9-Finals Week)

* Concepts of Machine Learning, scikit-learn
* Decision Trees
* Naive Bayes
* Introduction to computer vision, opencv2
* Pedestrian detection using Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), support vector machines (SVM), and sliding windows

## Grade Allocation

1. Quizzes (4) 40 pts
2. Homework (4) 40 pts
3. Course Project 20 pts
4. Attendance 5 pts

**Final Project** Homework assignments culminate in a final project: a complete application/game that utilizes the AI theories. **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**

## Grading Scale

* A: 94 to 100
* A-: 90 to 93
* B+: 85 to 89
* B: 80 to 84
* B-: 77 to 79
* C+: 74 to 76
* C: 70 to 73
* C-: 67 to 79
* D+: 64 to 66
* D: 60 to 69
* D-: 55 to 59
* F: 0 to 54

## ADA Statement

Reasonable accommodation will be provided to any student who is registered with the Office of Students with Disabilities and requests needed accommodation.

## Academic Integrity

Cheating on assignments and exams will not be tolerated. All parties involved will receive a grade of **F** for the course and be reported to the Computer Science Department.
